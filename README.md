This Tableau project presents an interactive dashboard built using the Superstore dataset, which contains detailed information on customer orders, sales performance, and regional distribution. The goal of this project is to visualize key business metrics such as total sales, profit trends, top-performing categories and sub-categories, shipping modes, and regional sales performance. Through dynamic charts, filters, and KPIs, the dashboard allows users to explore business insights, identify high-performing areas, and detect opportunities for improvement. The project includes the Tableau packaged workbook (Tableau_Dashboard_PROJECT.twbx) and the original dataset (sample_-_superstore.xlsx) for reference and further analysis.
